#WAP to print Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Poem in Python

#I solved it this way
'''print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star, \nHow I wonder what you are!\nUp above the world so high,\nLike a diamond in the sky.")'''

#If we have string that spans in more than one line, then we can wrap it inside triple single quote instead of one double quote

print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high, 
Like a diamond in the sky.
